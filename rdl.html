                <p class="text-center pb-3 ">The Romanian deadlift, or RDL for short, is a barbell or free weight exercise that targets the glutes, hamstrings, and core. Done correctly, it's an excellent move to add to a lower-body strength training routine as it hits just about everything on the backside of your body (your posterior chain). But, as a complex movement that engages multiple joints and muscle groups, it's easy to do the exercise with incorrect form, which increases the likelihood you could end up injured.

                    Generally speaking, if you're new to the movement, it's a good idea to work with a trainer or coach to make sure you're executing the RDL with good form.</p>

                <p class="text-center pt-3 ">All you need to get started is a barbell and weight plates.

                    Stand tall with your feet roughly hip-distance apart. Hold a barbell in both hands directly in front of your thighs with your hands shoulder-distance apart (slightly wider than your thighs).
                    Start with a very slight bend in your knees. Roll your shoulders back, drawing your shoulder blades toward your spine to engage your upper back. Your shoulders should remain pulled back like this throughout the exercise.
                    Inhale and press your hips back. Continue pressing them back (like your hips are hinging), as your torso naturally begins to lean forward toward the floor. It's important to realize you're not tipping forward at the waist. The movement of your torso only happens as a result of your hips hinging, not because you're actively leaning forward. Check to make sure you still have perfect posture and your shoulders and back aren't rounding forward.
                    Keep the barbell close to your thighs (almost grazing the front of them) as you hinge forward from the hips. If there are several inches between your body and the barbell, roll your shoulders back and pull the barbell closer to your body. Your arms should hang naturally down (elbows extended), but they should remain engaged to keep the barbell close to you.
                    Stop hinging at your hips when you feel a stretch through your hamstrings. The barbell does not have to reach the floor—in fact, it's perfectly fine if you stop the movement when the barbell reaches roughly knee-height, depending on your personal flexibility.
                    Exhale and use your hamstrings and glutes to "pull" your torso back to standing as you actively press your hips forward. You should not use your back or core to pull yourself back to standing.
                    Complete your set and replace the barbell carefully on the rack.</p>

                <h4 class="text-center pt-3">Benefits of Leg RDLs</h4>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 ">
                    The first benefit of the Romanian deadlift is how many muscle groups it targets at one time. This type of compound exercise is considered a functional movement that translates to other areas of life because when you move around in day-to-day life, you're not using a single muscle—you're using a combination of muscle groups to walk, run, bend, lift, and so forth.

The RDL, specifically, engages the hamstrings, glutes, core, and even your upper back, shoulders, and forearms. By developing strength through these areas, activities of daily life, like walking and picking up items from the floor, become easier to perform.

Also, unlike other common lower-body compound exercises, like the squat and lunge, the RDL focuses primarily on the hamstrings, rather than the quadriceps. For individuals who do a lot of squats and lunges, the Romanian deadlift can help "balance out" any imbalances that may start to develop between the strength of the anterior and posterior sides of your body.

Finally, as you develop greater strength and power in your hamstrings and glutes, you'll find these strength gains translate to other exercises, too. You'll be able to lift more, more comfortably, when going through your traditional strength training routine.
