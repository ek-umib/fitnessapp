                <p class="text-center pb-3 ">Squats are a common addition to many fitness routines, whether they're performed using just bodyweight or with weight added. Expanding the styles of squat you practice provides extra options, as well as physical benefits.

                    A style of squat you may want to consider adding to your rotation is half squats. These squats require you to lower your body down so that your thighs are parallel to the floor (this is also known as squatting "to parallel"). While the name may point to a lesser exercise, half squats have a legitimate place in any strength training program.
                    
                    Half squats are a great option for all individuals, no matter how deep your natural squat is. What’s more, the depth of your squat ability is primarily based on your anatomy, which is out of your control. Other factors, like mobility and range of motion, come into play as well, which are areas you can work on to increase the depth of your squat if desired.
                    
                    Half squats get a bad rap among those who believe the deeper the squat, the better, but this is not feasible for many people. Half squats are beneficial if you are working on overcoming a strength plateau or you are in the process of increasing your mobility and range of motion.</p>

                <p class="text-center pt-3 ">While the ideal width, foot position, and barbell position can differ for each person, there are general cues that most people can start from when performing squats.1 If you want to work on your sticking point, in particular, to push past a plateau, you can add a pause at the bottom of the half squat before returning to standing.

                    Follow these directions for performing half squats. If you need to make adjustments based on your anatomy or are unsure about your form, seek guidance from a personal trainer or another exercise specialist.
                    
                    Place your feet about shoulder-width apart, pointing ahead with a slight angle outward (about 5 to 7 degrees for most people during a bodyweight squat, a bit more for a barbell squat).
                    Create an arch in your foot, pressing down with your heel, the base of your first toe, and the base of your 5th toe to create a sort of tripod—this will provide stability and even distribution of your weight.
                    Drive your hips back into a hip hinge, bringing your chest forward, engaging your glutes and hamstrings.
                    Squeeze your glutes and drive your knees out to create tension and external rotation in your hips. You should feel your outer hips engage—this helps you safely maintain form, protecting your knees and back as you descend into the squat further. Be sure to keep the arch in your feet with all three points still touching the ground.
                    Keep your neck and torso in an upright, neutral position. Look ahead and at a slight angle downward.
                    Descend to the desired position, either to parallel or just above, keeping balanced with your weight evenly distributed in your feet. For a half squat, your shins should be as vertical as possible.
                    Drive your hips up and back, pulling in your shins to vertical as you return to standing (the ascent).</p>

                <h4 class="text-center pt-3">Benefits of Leg Squats</h4>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 ">
                    Learning to squat below parallel has advantages, such as increasing active knee stability and reducing sports injury risk to the knee—but only if performed correctly; otherwise, injury can result. Working on half squats while consistently training to increase your range of motion is wise if you cannot squat below parallel while maintaining proper form.

                    Performing half squats intentionally also can help you push past strength plateaus. If you have what’s known as a “sticking point” in your squat technique, where it is much more difficult during the top phase of the squat, training half squats can help increase your strength in that area, pushing you past your plateau. 
                    
                    Half squats are also a vital element of the push press exercise. If you want to improve that particular lift, working on your half-squat power and technique is beneficial. For this purpose, use an explosive motion when you reach the bottom of the half squat to return to the starting position.
