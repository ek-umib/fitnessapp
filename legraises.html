                <p class="text-center pt-3 text-white">Hanging leg raises require the use of a bar that you can grasp above your head. Some ab machines provide these features. This bar must be stable and able to support your full body weight, as well as withstand the stress that is added when you raise and lower your legs.

                    A pull-up bar is a good choice. A round bar is more comfortable to grasp than a squared-off bar or square wooden beam. Don't use a door frame or ledge, as this isn't safe.
                    
                    Some bars have hooks or rings that you can grasp. Others have ab straps attached, providing support to your upper arms while you grasp the bar with your hands.
                    
                    Grab the bar with an overhand grip, your thumbs wrapped around the bar to improve stability. You don't have to necessarily be hanging at this stage but, ideally, your hands should be grasping the bar well above your head.
                    
                    Exhale as you lift your feet off the ground, raising your straight legs outward in front of you. Tilt your pelvis slightly back and engage your abdominals and hip flexors to assist with the movement.
                    Raise your legs to a level that feels challenging but still enables you to keep good form. Strive to get them parallel to the ground (so that your hips are bent at 90 degrees), or a little higher if you can.
                    Lower your legs back down slowly until they return to the starting position, inhaling during this portion of the exercise. Maintain your posterior pelvic tilt, even at the bottom of the movement.</p>

                <h4 class="text-center pt-3">Benefits of Leg Raises</h4>
                <p class="text-center pt-3 text-white">
                    Both primary hip flexors—the sartorius and the iliopsoas—work hard during hanging leg raises. The longest muscle in the body, the sartorius assists with hip and knee flexion. The iliopsoas flexes the hip to draw the thighs to the trunk, aids in side bending, and flexes the lumbar spine.1

The rectus femoris, tensor fasciae latae, pectineus, and adductor longus are synergistic muscles that are also activated during the hanging leg raise. The stabilizing abdominal muscles during this exercise are the rectus abdominus and the obliques.

While the traditional crunch and its variants give a top-down approach to working the abs, the hanging leg raise is a bottom-up approach that works them in a different way than many other exercises.2 Advanced exercisers can use this movement to vary their ab routine.

The effects you get from this exercise depend on how far you are able to raise your legs—but you will feel your abdominals working hard at just about any level. A strong core makes it easier to lift heavy items while also supporting a healthy posture.
